At times it seems like there's too much content, or the labs just aren't making sense. Just remember to keep plugging away. We all have our reason for learning and signing up for the bootcamp, some people its financial, some people its just a desire to learn, some people want to move away from working in an office and move to an at home career; but whatever the reason just hold onto it and keep plugging away. 

Currently, I'm in the first mile, and I've fallen so behind on the lessons. Between work and life, and anxiety surrounding all of the chaos in the world from Covid, to civil unrest, its okay that I'm behind, because just going to keep plugging away. With this at the end I know I'll have the satisfaction of accomplishment and the knowlege of a skill that bears so much importance in this world. 

So this blogpost is for everyone who is experiencing and self doubt, or worry that they wont make it through the program, hopefully it serves as a positive affirmation that you can in fact do it, as long as you just keep plugging away.

Nothing but love,

FJS
