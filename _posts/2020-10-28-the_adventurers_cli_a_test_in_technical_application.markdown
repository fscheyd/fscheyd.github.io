In many professions, there are a certain level of skill that has to be aquired to perform the regular functions of a job. After the knowlege is gained one has to apply the information to live situations. When I was working for a utility meter installation company we had rigorous training breaking down the process of installation and the many safety protocols needed, but when that was over more often then not new installers would be tried in the field because the actual application of information needed to have been done.  Similarly with this project, there were many instances in where I realized that this was a more realistic application of the information learned.


In the first mile of the FlatIron curriculum most of the educational content and work was very test driven. That took every concept and put it in a box, when it came to the context of application, but for the project everything was very conceptual. There were no tests to pull my errors from, so everything was nebulous in regards to starting the project. fortunately, with all of the help from my fellow students and cohort leaders, I was able to put together a pretty nice ruby CLI gem. 

I am a very big nerd, and fancy some tabletop fantasy. Naturally when we had the option to select our own API to use I went with a Dungeons & Dragons API. D&D is a game with a lot of content and information to sort through, so it made it easy to find a very functional API for the purposes of this project. With that, considering the many aspects in play when it comes to the playing of D&D (Races, Classes, Backgrounds, Spells, Items, Monsters, etc.), I went with Monsters. The reason I chose monsters over anything else was because out of all the data that was presented when I went into the API data, the monsters were mostly integers, and several small strings, and it had the least amount of arrays within these insances, and I felt it might be easier to work with this than an array within an array within an array, plus there were pages upon pages of monsters that I could use. Ironically enough the project only ended up needing so much so the first page of 50 monsters was more than enough.

In the game of D&D there are many challenges a party of heroes may face: puzzles, dragons, demons, traps, powerful mages, difficult terrain, and just surviving in general. Fitting the narrative of a D&D themed project, I too ran into several problems. Fortunately these problems were not grand beasts to battle valiantly with sword, shield, and the knowlege of spellcraft. What I ended up battling was my conceptual understandings of certain aspects. Mostly was my understanding of local instances and being able to differentiate class and local instances. If I had any advice for someone adventuring into the mystical realm of coding the advice I'd offer is this: "Take your time, and really understand that local instances are nearby and class instances are all encompassing. Also, if you dont understand right away, keep plugging away and it will come to you. Perservearence is key."

This would actually be a very useful CLI for a player character in game, and theres certain functionalities I would love to add. One of them is to have access to all of the monsters within the lore and expansive universe of D&D, but for a user to only access the monsters they've seen in game, which would require a function where a user would have to log into a profile and pull up what they've seen. So the more they see (in game), the more they know. Reason being that in D&D theres a thing called metagaming, which is when a player acts on information their character might not know. Also I'd love for the user to access information about the monsters attacks and abilities. Some of the strongest monsters have pages on pages of info to view.

At the start of this project it was daunting, and immense. But, as any adventurer would do I marched on through the vastness of the concepts of understanding information, and was able to vanquish the beast of this project.
